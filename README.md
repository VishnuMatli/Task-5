# ðŸ“¡ Cyber Security Internship - Task 5: Wireshark Packet Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify basic protocols in use.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (free packet analyzer)
- **Browser & ping commands** to generate traffic

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
| File                    | Description                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `task5_capture.pcapng`  | Wireshark packet capture file      |
| `wireshark_report.md`   | Summary of protocols identified    |
| `screenshot.png`        | Wireshark UI during capture        |

---

## ðŸ§ª Protocols Observed

| Protocol | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| DNS      | Domain name resolution|
| TCP      | Reliable transport    |
| ICMP     | Echo request (ping)   |

## ðŸ§  Interview Questions & Sample Answers

1. **What is Wireshark used for?**  
   To capture and analyze network packets for troubleshooting and security inspection.

2. **What is a packet?**  
   A packet is a unit of data transmitted over a network.

3. **How to filter packets in Wireshark?**  
   Use filters like `http`, `tcp`, `icmp` in the filter bar.

4. **TCP vs UDP?**  
   TCP is reliable and connection-based. UDP is faster but connectionless.

5. **What is a DNS query packet?**  
   A DNS packet contains a request to resolve a domain to an IP.

6. **How does packet capture help troubleshooting?**  
   It shows what's happening on the networkâ€”errors, delays, failed handshakes, etc.

7. **What is a protocol?**  
   A set of rules governing communication over a network (e.g., HTTP, TCP, DNS).

8. **Can Wireshark decrypt traffic?**  
   Only if decryption keys are available (like SSL keys for HTTPS).

## âœ… Conclusion
This task improved my understanding of packet structures, protocols, and real-time traffic analysis using Wireshark.
